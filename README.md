# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.

  Using Leaflet I plotted all of the earthquakes, that occured in 1 day, based on thier longitude and latitude.

   * Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color

   * Popups provide additional information about the earthquake

   * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data
